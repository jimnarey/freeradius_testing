## Setting up 802.1X at home: a personal journey


### Purpose

To setup a free-standing FreeRADIUS server and access point to enable risk free config testing on a home LAN. This readme assumes as
little technical knowledge as possibe.

### Requirements

- A machine which can run Linux docker containers (i.e. a machine running Linux or MacOS).

- A home LAN. A standard router with at least one free ethernet port is sufficient.

- An access point, in addition to any router providing your Internet connection, which supports WPA Enterprise / 802.1X WiFi authentication. This was tested with a Netgear DGN2000 which does. An old Sky Hub I checked did not.
